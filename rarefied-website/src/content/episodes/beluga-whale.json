  "description": "On this episode of Rarified listeners are introduced to the beluga whale. Renowned for its unique vocalizations and smiling visage, the beluga whale inhabits the Arctic and sub-Arctic waters. With conservation scientist William Halliday, the podcast dives into the life of belugas, exploring their behaviors, unique adaptations, and the threats they face, such as climate change and increased human activity in the Arctic. They discuss conservation efforts, traditional ecological knowledge from Indigenous communities, and how studies like acoustic monitoring and tagging help understand and protect these 'canaries of the sea.'www.arcticnoise.cahttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-wilderness-lemming-suicide/further reading: Martin et al. 2023 https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.12978 Halliday et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic69294Chapters00:00 Introduction to Rarified Podcast00:26 Exploring the Beluga Whale01:36 Interview with William Halliday02:36 Beluga Whale B",
