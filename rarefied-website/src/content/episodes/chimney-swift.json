Despite their global security, Chimney Swifts face vulnerability and imperilment across Canada. Meredith is joined by experts Gabriel Evans Cook, Ontario's aerial insectivore biologist, and Gwendolyn Clark, coordinator of the Chimney Swift Chimney Restoration Fund at Birds Canada. They discuss the Chimney Swift's adaptation to urban environments, the threats they face, and the initiatives in place to conserve their habitat.
